# IMUDynamicPositioning

IMUDynamicPositioning is a project designed to implement dynamic positioning using Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) data. This system aims to accurately determine and control the position of a moving object by processing IMU data.

## Features

- Collects and processes IMU data
- Implements algorithms for dynamic positioning
- Provides a framework for integrating IMU data with positioning systems

## Prerequisites

- C++ Compiler (e.g., GCC)
- CMake

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/akui1321/IMUDynamicPositioning.git
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd IMUDynamicPositioning
3. Build the project using CMake:
   ```bash
   mkdir build
   cd build
   cmake ..
   make
## Usage

1. Run the executable:
   ```bash
   ./IMUDynamicPositioning
2. The program will start collecting and processing IMU data for dynamic positioning.
